BUSINESS IMPACT METRICS - REAL vs MADE UP
==========================================

✅ REAL DATA:
-------------

1. Product Prices
CODE:
    COALESCE(p."ProductPrice", 50) as unit_price
PROOF: Pulled from Product_Lookup.ProductPrice column in database


2. Product Costs  
CODE:
    COALESCE(p."ProductCost", p."ProductPrice" * 0.6, 30) as unit_cost
PROOF: Pulled from Product_Lookup.ProductCost column (fallback: 60% of price if missing)


3. Current Stock Levels
CODE:
    stocks = int(product_rows.iloc[0]["Stock"])
PROOF: From stock_table database, real inventory numbers


4. Forecast Predictions
CODE:
    forecast_lower_limit = sum(forecast_data.iloc[:4]["Lower 80%"])
    forecast_upper_limit = sum(forecast_data.iloc[:4]["Upper 80%"])
PROOF: From your Holt-Winters ML model output (top10_products_forecast_results.csv)


5. Actual Sales Data
CODE:
    last_4_weeks_sale = sum(sales_data.iloc[-4:]["sum"])
PROOF: From your historical sales CSV (top10_product_ts.csv)


6. Forecast Accuracy (MAPE)
CODE:
    mape = np.mean(np.abs((actual_last_4 - forecast_median) / np.maximum(actual_last_4, 1))) * 100
PROOF: Real calculation comparing actual vs predicted sales



🔴 MADE UP / ESTIMATED:
-----------------------

1. Emergency Orders Per Product
CODE:
    emergency_orders_prevented = stockout_metrics["products_at_risk"] * 2
                                                                         ^^^
MADE UP: Assumes 2 emergency orders per at-risk product per month
NO HISTORICAL DATA: Would need past emergency order logs


2. Emergency Order Extra Cost
CODE:
    avg_emergency_order_cost = 100
                               ^^^
MADE UP: Assumes $100 extra cost per emergency order
NO HISTORICAL DATA: Would need actual rush shipping invoices


3. Carrying Cost Rate
CODE:
    annual_carrying_cost_saved = excess_inventory_value * 0.25
                                                          ^^^^
MADE UP: Uses 25% (industry standard)
REAL WOULD NEED: Warehouse rent, insurance, opportunity cost data


4. USD to MYR Conversion (Frontend)
CODE:
    const USD_TO_MYR = 4.47;
                       ^^^^
MADE UP: Hardcoded exchange rate
REAL WOULD NEED: Live exchange rate API



📊 SUMMARY:
-----------
REAL (6 things):
- Product prices
- Product costs  
- Stock levels
- ML forecasts
- Historical sales
- Forecast accuracy

MADE UP (4 things):
- Emergency order frequency (× 2)
- Emergency order cost ($100)
- Carrying cost rate (25%)
- Exchange rate (4.47)
